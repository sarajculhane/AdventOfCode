# AdventOfCode 2020
Solutions for AoC 2020.  Solutions are my own with minimal to no outside aids.  If I do use a resource for a particular puzzle,
I will indicate such.

My main goal with participating is to tackle interesting problems each day.  Ideally, I hope to optimize some of the problems further and will do so when time permits.
